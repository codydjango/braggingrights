# everyday

## Get your minimum done, every day.

Everyday is an ethereum-integrated habit-former. As difficult tasks become habitual, update your routine for continuous improvement.

It takes 30 days to normalize a new habit. Get started now.

### How does this work?

Create routine checklists, get things done, and monitor your progress. Commit to getting things done, and see how you fare against other people who choose the same tasks.

If that's not enough to keep you motivated, gamble on whether you achieve your goals. Win back your ether plus your share of the ether that other people lost!

To win, sign in by the target date to report your progress.

#### Caveats

This game functions on the basis of an "honor-code". It's entirely possible for you to not achieve your goal but claim that you have.
