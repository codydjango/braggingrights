# everyday

## Get the bare minimum done, every day.

Everyday is an ethereum-integrated habit-former. As difficult tasks become habitual, update your routine for continuous improvement.

[The everyday-api](https://github.com/codydjango/everyday-api/) provides for signed message verification and persistent sessions. Try it out live on [github.io](https://codydjango.github.io/everyday/).
